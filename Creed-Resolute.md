# Creed Resolute

The Tome of the Creed Resolute, or simply the Creed Resolute, is the guide book which all members of the Order of the Companion and Hellriders swear to live by.

Text from the first page of the Creed Resolute: 

_I solemnly pledge my soul and blood and blade to serve as a knight of Elturel and share the Oath of the High Observer in honoring the Gift of the Companion. I shall guard the realm of Elturgard and all those lands which lie under Elturel’s Shield, upholding the laws of Elturgard and the commands of the High Observer. I shall live my life in strict accord to the Creed Resolute, placing it and this oath above all other doctrines. I shall be bound to all others who swear this oath, declaring them now and forevermore, whether in life or beyond the veil of death, to be my brothers in arms. To ensure the perfect harmony of our brotherhood, I shall permit no difference in faith to come between us, but rather hold the Companion, which I shall never attribute to one god or another, as our common star._


## Content
The Creed Resolute was the founding document of the Order of the Companions, but in the 1470’s it was also “adopted” by the Hellriders. 

The first page of the Tome of the Creed Resolute contains contains the formal oath all who swear by the Creed must agree to.  
The next several pages contain the full text of the Creed itself. The full Creed is a lengthy document proscribing and prescribing various courses of action that are “right and proper” for a knight. This includes some guidance that’s ethical and moral, following a chivalry-style code, and other guidance that’s more practical, such as codes of dress and the list of arms and armor which any follower of the Creed must maintain.
 
The back of the Tome of the Creed Resolute is magic. Every person who swears on the Creed must prick their thumb place the blood-mark on one of the back pages of the Tome. The signature of the swearer then appears underneath each blood-mark, and the Tome magically gains pages whenever it appears to be running out.
 
## Purpose
 
The Creed Resolute was created during the founding days of the Order of the Companion to encompass all the rules and guidelines the new order would live and operate under. While containing practical information, such as armor maintenance, and a general guideline of behavior deemed appropriate for knights, above all the tome was created to unite all the people who swear it under one oath to protect Elturel and its people.
