# Shield of the Hidden Lord

What Sylvira Savikas know about the shield:

- It was created by Gargauth, an archduke and demigod of Hell.
- Gargauth can speak through the shield.
- Anyone in contact with the shield is said to hear the Whisperings of the Hidden Lord. It’s unclear whether Gargauth can read or control the wearers’ thoughts, but it can definitely communicate telepathically with them.
- In some accounts, the wielder of the shield can create walls of fire and fireballs.
- It’s possible that there are multiple such shields, each allowing Gargauth to speak through it but perhaps manifesting a unique cluster of magical powers. In any case, the shield has turned up repeatedly throughout history, always as the instigator of great evil.


# Infernal puzzleboxes

What Sylvira Savikas know about puzzleboxes:

- They are crafted by devils of the Nine Hells.
- They are usually made of infernal iron, but some are made of bone or horn.
- They are designed to safeguard their contents, but also as infernal temptations. “Any lock can be picked. But a puzzle entices.”
- The process of solving the incredibly intricate puzzles which seal the box, if done incorrectly, can lure a person into unwittingly performing an infernal rite that will bind them to the devil who made the box.

# Charge of the Hellriders

Retold by Reya Mantlemorn: 

"It was centuries past that the great troubles began. Fiends roamed the lands to the north and west of Elturel. Fields were despoiled, livestock slaughtered, homes razed, and people dragged off to a terrible and unknowable fate. Terror gripped the hearts of all.

"The city's cavalry rode across the land, striking down fiends wherever they found them and suffering fearful losses. But it was never enough. For every fiend they destroyed, it seemed as though two more appeared elsewhere. The ruler of Elturel, the High Rider, asked his people to pray to the gods for aid. To everyone's astonishment, a mighty angel entered the city the next day. The prayers of Elturel had been heard, and help had come.

"The angel located the gate through which the fiends were entering the natural world, on the Fields of the Dead west of the city. Th Angel declared that she would lead the cavalry into Avernus, destroying the infernal host that was amassing there, and striking a great blow against the forces of darkness.

"The High Rider sent out the riders of Elturel, now numbering many thousands, with the angel at their head, riding a golden mastodon. With a great cry, the angel and her army charged through the gate. The legions of Avernus trembled and buckled, but did not crumble. The angel was defeated, and the remnants of her army returned to Elturel, overcome with grief at the loss of their glorious general but confident that the lords of the Nine Hells would think twice about threatening Elturel again.

"There were great celebrations to honor the valiant knights of the cavalry, who became known as Hellriders from that day on."
