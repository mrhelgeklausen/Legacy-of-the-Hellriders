# Shield of the Hidden Lord

- It was created by Gargauth, an archduke and demigod of Hell.
- Gargauth can speak through the shield.
- Anyone in contact with the shield is said to hear the Whisperings of the Hidden Lord. It’s unclear whether Gargauth can read or control the wearers’ thoughts, but it can definitely communicate telepathically with them.
- In some accounts, the wielder of the shield can create walls of fire and fireballs.
- It’s possible that there are multiple such shields, each allowing Gargauth to speak through it but perhaps manifesting a unique cluster of magical powers. In any case, the shield has turned up repeatedly throughout history, always as the instigator of great evil.


# Infernal puzzleboxes

- They are crafted by devils of the Nine Hells.
- They are usually made of infernal iron, but some are made of bone or horn.
- They are designed to safeguard their contents, but also as infernal temptations. “Any lock can be picked. But a puzzle entices.”
- The process of solving the incredibly intricate puzzles which seal the box, if done incorrectly, can lure a person into unwittingly performing an infernal rite that will bind them to the devil who made the box.
