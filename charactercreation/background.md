# Character Bakground

## Background Features
**Ability Scores**. When you determine your
character’s ability scores, choose two of them,
and increase one by 2 and the other one by 1.
Alternatively, choose three ability scores, and
increase each of them by 1.[^1]

**Skill Proficiencies**. Choose two Skills. Your
character gains Proficiency in them.

**Tool Proficiency**. Choose one tool. Your character
gains Tool Proficiency* with it.

**Language**. Choose one language from the
Standard Languages and Rare Languages tables
(these appear later in the document). Your
character knows that language.

**Feat**. Choose one  [1st-level Feat](feats "title") . Your character
gains that Feat.

**Equipment**. Your character gains 50 GP to spend
on starting equipment. The character keeps any
unspent GP as spare coin.


[^1]: Since 2014, characters have received ability score
increases from several sources, either from a Race
that has the Ability Score Increase trait or from
the ability score rules in Tasha’s Cauldron of
Everything, Monsters of the Multiverse, and other
books. If you make a character using one of those
older sources and get ability score increases from
it, the character doesn’t also get ability score
increases from Background, unless you forgo the
older ability score increases to gain the increases
from the Background rules here.
