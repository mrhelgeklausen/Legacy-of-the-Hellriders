  <b>Ability score increases from elsewhere</b><br>
Since 2014, characters have received ability score
increases from several sources, either from a Race
that has the Ability Score Increase trait or from
the ability score rules in Tasha’s Cauldron of
Everything, Monsters of the Multiverse, and other
books. If you make a character using one of those
older sources and get ability score increases from
it, the character doesn’t also get ability score
increases from Background, unless you forgo the
older ability score increases to gain the increases
from the Background rules here.

## SAMPLE BACKGROUNDS
Here is a collection of sample Backgrounds that
you can choose from when making a character.
These Backgrounds were built using the rules in
the “Build Your Background” section, and each
of them contains story-oriented details that are
meant inspire you as you think of your
character’s backstory.

**Skill Proficiencies**: Insight, Religion <br>
**Tool Proficiency**: Calligrapher’s Supplies <br>
**Language**: Celestial <br>
**Feat**: Magic Initiate (Divine)

You devoted yourself to service in a temple,
either nestled in a town or secluded in a sacred
grove. There you performed hallowed rites in
honor of a god or pantheon. You served under a
priest and studied religion. Thanks to your
priest’s instruction and your own devotion, you
also learned how to channel a modicum of
divine power in service to your place of worship
and the people who prayed there.

**Language**: Gnomish <br>
**Feat**: Crafter

You began mopping floors and scrubbing
counters in an artisan’s workshop for a few
coppers per day as soon as you were strong
enough to carry a bucket. When you were
finally old enough to apprentice, you learned to
create basic crafts of your own, as well as how
to sweet-talk the occasional demanding
customer. As part of your studies, you picked up
Gnomish, the tongue from which so many of the
artisan’s terms of art are derived.

**Skill Proficiencies**: Deception, Sleight of Hand <br>
**Tool Proficiency**: Forgery Kit <br>
**Language**: Infernal <br>
**Feat**: Skilled

Soon after you were old enough to order an ale,
you already had a favorite stool in every tavern
within ten miles of where you were born. As
you traveled the circuit from public house to
watering hole, you learned to prey on the
unfortunates who were in the market for a
comforting lie or two—perhaps a sham potion
or a forged “treasure map.” You are fluent in
Infernal, the ancient Language of deception.

**Tool Proficiency**: Thieves’ Tools <br>
**Language**: Thieves’ Cant <br>
**Feat**: Alert

You learned to earn your coin in dark alleyways,
cutting purses or burgling shops. Perhaps you
were part of a small gang of like-minded
wrongdoers, who looked out for each other. Or
maybe you were a lone wolf, fending for
yourself against the local thieves’ guild and
older, more fearsome lawbreakers.

**Skill Proficiencies**: Arcana, Religion <br>
**Tool Proficiency**: Disguise Kit <br>
**Language**: Abyssal <br>
**Feat**: Magic Initiate (Arcane)

You scarcely recall what drove you into the
service of the otherworldly being. Those
memories were blotted out long ago by
recurrent dreams of midnight gatherings round
the obsidian pillar in the glade. By the light of
each waning moon, the hierophants instructed
you in the being’s creed and the rudiments of
the arcane arts. When you came of age, you
were ordered to blend in among the
nonbelievers and await whatever mission the
Great One has in store for you.

**Feat**: Musician

You spent much of your youth following roving
fairs and carnivals, performing odd jobs for
musicians and acrobats in exchange for lessons.
You may have learned how to walk a tightrope,
how to double pick a lute, or how to recite
Elvish poetry with the impeccable trills of an elf
poet. To this day, you thrive on applause and
long for the stage.

**Language**: Halfling <br>
**Feat**: Tough

You grew up close to the land. Years tending
animals and cultivating the earth rewarded you
with patience and good health. You have a keen
appreciation for nature’s bounty alongside a
healthy respect for nature’s wrath. Like many
farmers, you made frequent use of the
agricultural almanacs produced by the greatest
halfling farmers.

**Skill Proficiencies**: Athletics, Performance <br>
**Tool Proficiency**: Smith’s Tools <br>
**Language**: Orc <br>
**Feat**: Savage Attacker

Your first few appearances in the gladiatorial
pits led you to appreciate every one of the scars
you carry from your instructors and sparring
partners. Each scar was a lesson that taught you
how to best your opponents and curry favor
with the crowds your brawls entertained. Your
time in the pits left you with a strong hand and
a strong heart. You’ll forever share a
remarkable bond with the other pit fighters in
your stable—humans, dragonborn, dwarves,
and orcs—hardened warriors all.

**Tool Proficiency**: Gaming Set* (one of your choice) <br>
**Language**: Dwarvish <br>
**Feat**: Alert

Your feet begin to ache when you remember the
countless hours you spent at your post in the
tower. You were trained to keep one eye
outside the wall, watching for marauders
sweeping from the nearby forest, and your
other eye inside the wall, searching for
cutpurses and troublemakers. At the end of
each shift, you bunked in the mayor’s barracks
alongside your fellow sentries and the dwarven
smiths who kept your armor snug and your
weapons sharp.

**Skill Proficiencies**: Stealth, Survival <br>
**Tool Proficiency**: Cartographer’s Tools <br>
**Language**: Giant <br>
**Feat**: Magic Initiate (Primal)

You came of age in the outdoors, far from
settled lands. Your home? Anywhere you chose
to unfurl your bedroll. There are wonders on
the frontier—strange monsters, pristine forests
and streams, overgrown ruins of great halls
once trod by giants—and you learned to fend
for yourself as you explored them. From time to
time, you traveled with a pair of friendly druids
who were kind enough to instruct you in the
fundamentals of channeling the magic of the
wild.

**Ability Scores:** +2 Wisdom, +1 Constitution <br>
**Skill Proficiencies**: Medicine, Religion <br>
**Tool Proficiency**: Herbalism Kit <br>
**Language**: Sylvan <br>
**Feat**: Magic Initiate (Primal)

You spent your early years secluded in a hut or
monastery located well beyond the outskirts of
the nearest settlement. In those days, your only
companions were the creatures of the forest,
who would occasionally visit to bring news of
the outside world and supplies. The quiet and
solitude you found in your time outside society
allowed you to spend many hours pondering
the mysteries of creation, attuning your mind to
the magical energy flowing through the natural
world.

**Skill Proficiencies**: Athletics, Survival <br>
**Tool Proficiency**: Mason’s Tools <br>
**Language**: Dwarvish <br>
**Feat**: Tough

Your apprenticeship consumed the better part
of your youth. First, you learned to cut and
polish a stone. After several years of polishing
stones, you learned how to cement those stones
into a wall. After several years building walls,
you learned to join your walls to form a
structure. The structures you built were
exceptionally durable. The masons who taught
you were taught by even older masons who
were taught by dwarf artisans of old.

**Skill Proficiencies**: History, Persuasion <br>
**Tool Proficiency**: Gaming Set* (one of your choice) <br>
**Language**: Draconic <br>
**Feat**: Skilled

You were raised in a castle as a creature of
wealth, power, and privilege—none of it earned.
Your family are minor aristocrats who saw to it
that you received a first-class education, some
of which you appreciated and some of which
you resented. (Was it truly necessary to read all
those ancient histories in their original
Draconic?) Your time in the castle, especially
the many hours you spent observing your
family at court, also taught you a great deal
about leadership.

**Language**: Halfling <br>
**Feat**: Healer

You and a group of like-minded believers—
mostly humans and halflings—once endeavored
to walk a thousand miles of road to reach a
faraway shrine. Priests counseled at the outset
that, long after your journey was complete,
you’d come to realize that you found the key to
your salvation not at your destination, but
somewhere along the road that led there.

**Tool Proficiency**: Calligrapher’s Supplies <br>
**Language**: Elvish <br>
**Feat**: Magic Initiate (Arcane)

You spent your formative years traveling
between manors and monasteries, performing
various odd jobs and services in exchange for
access to their libraries. You wiled away many a
long evening with your nose buried in books
and scrolls, learning the lore of the multiverse—
even the rudiments of magic—and your mind
only yearns for more.

**Language**: Primordial <br>
**Feat**: Tavern Brawler

Thus far, you’ve spent most of your days living
the life of a seafarer, wind at your back and
decks swaying beneath your feet, as you sailed
toward your next adventure. You’ve perched on
barstools in more ports of call than you can
remember, faced down mighty storms, and
swapped stories with the folk who live beneath
the waves
.

**Language**: Goblin <br>
**Feat**: Savage Attacker

You began training for war at such an early age
that you carry only a precious few memories of
what life was like before you took up arms.
Battle is in your blood. Sometimes you catch
yourself reflexively performing the basic
fighting exercises you learned as a youth.
Eventually, you put that training to use on the
battlefield, protecting the realm by waging war
and studying the strategies of goblinoid
generals.

You grew up on the streets, surrounded by
similarly ill-fated castoffs, a few of them friends
and a few of them rivals. You slept where you
could and did odd jobs for food. At times, when
the hunger became unbearable, you resorted to
theft. Still, you never lost your pride and never
abandoned hope. Fate is not yet finished with
you.
