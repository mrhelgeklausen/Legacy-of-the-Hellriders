# Starting languages
Your character begins play knowing at least
three languages: Common, a language provided
by the character’s Background, and a language
that you choose from the Standard Languages
table below. Knowledge of a language means your character can communicate in that
language and can read and write it.

The Standard Languages table lists languages
that are widespread on D&D worlds in the
Material Plane, and the Rare Languages table
lists languages that are more rarely known on
those worlds. In each table, typical users of a
language are mentioned.
