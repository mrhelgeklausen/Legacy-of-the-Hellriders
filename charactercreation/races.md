If the chosen effect has options within it, you choose one of those options for the device when you create it. For example, if you choose the spell’s ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites  or extinguishes fire; the device doesn’t do both. <br><br> You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each one dismantles itself 8 hours after its creation.
