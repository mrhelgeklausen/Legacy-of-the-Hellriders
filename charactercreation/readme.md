### Determining your origin
After choosing your character’s Class, it’s time
to consider the character’s origin. Who are the
character’s ancestors? And how did the
character spend the years leading up to a life of
adventure? To help answer those questions, you
choose three things for the character:

[Races](races "title")

[Backgrounds](background "title")

[Languages](languages "title")
