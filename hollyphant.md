# Hollyphant Race

![hollyphant](/images/hollyphant.jpg "Hollyphant")


Hollyphants are Celestial elephantine creatures from the
Upper Planes who work for the forces of good. Small,
golden-furred, and winged, hollyphants perform a variety
of tasks for deities and their agents to bring about a
better world for everyone.

As the helpers of good-aligned deities, hollyphants are
often sent to the Material plane to complete missions.
This includes delivering messages from the Celestial
planes to trusted agents, or acting as advisors to people
during times of distress. Hollyphants usually don’t
directly interfere with events on the Material plane if they
can help it, instead opting to gently guide people down
the right path. Adventurers who work for or have gained
the favor of deities like Ilmater or Mystryl may receive a
visit and some wise words from a hollyphant.

beings, hollyphants take their names very seriously.

**Tusks**. Your tusks are natural melee weapons, which
you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with

a trumpet sound that can be heard out to a range of 600

you finish a short or long rest. The trumpet also creates
a 30-foot cone of energy that has one of the following
effects that you choose:

- **Trumpet of Blasting**. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. The damage increases to 3d6 at
6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. Nonmagical objects damaged by this ability take twice as much thunder damage.
- **Trumpet of Sparkles**. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). Evilcreatures in the cone have disadvantage on their saving
throw. On a failed save, any creature that is not Good takes 2d6 radiant damage. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. Hollyphant Magic. You know the light cantrip. When you

spellcasting ability for these spells. When you cast them
with this trait, they don’t require components, and any
spent abilities from this trait are regained daily at dawn.
