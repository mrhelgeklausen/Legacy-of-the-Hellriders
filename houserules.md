## Rest

The campaign uses a modified version of the resting
system. This makes the use of resources lit Hit Dice,
potions and spells more important to players.

### Short Rest
When taking a 10 minute downtime a
character can:

Regain and use abilities that indicate they require a
short rest (e.g., a warlock’s spell slots).
- Spend Hit Dice, one at a time, to regain hit points (up to their maximum Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level).

### Long Rest
When taking 8 hours downtime a character
with at least 1 hit point can:
- Regain and use abilities that indicate they require a long rest.
- Regain a number of spent Hit Dice equal to half the character’s total number of Hit Dice (minimum 1).
- Reduce their exhaustion level by 1, if they have also ingested food and drink.

### Full Rest
When taking 24 hours downtime in a safe
area a character with at least 1 hit point can:
- Same features as a long rest.
- Regain all lost hit points.

## Burgeoning Heroes
Each character begins with 5 extra hit points.

## Death Saves
To add even more tension to these moments, the player
make the death save in secret. This means the other
players won't know how close that character is to death,
adding a sense of urgency to the moment that it might
not otherwise have.

A failed Death Save result in one level of excaustion.
