## Rest

The campaign uses a modified version of the resting
system. This makes the use of resources lit Hit Dice,
potions and spells more important to players.

### Short Rest
When taking a <span style="background:yellow">10 minute</span>  downtime a
character can:

Regain and use abilities that indicate they require a
short rest (e.g., a warlock’s spell slots).
- Spend Hit Dice, one at a time, to regain hit points (up to their maximum Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level).

### Long Rest
When taking 8 hours downtime (6 hours of sleep)  a character
with at least 1 hit point can:
- Regain and use abilities that indicate they require a long rest.
- Regain a number of spent Hit Dice equal to half the character’s total number of Hit Dice (minimum 1).
- Reduce their exhaustion level by 1, if they have also ingested food and drink.
- <span style="background:yellow">You do NOT regain all lost hit points. </span>
- _Spend Hit Dice, one at a time, to regain hit points (up to their maximum Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level)._

### Full Rest
When taking 24 hours downtime in a safe
area a character with at least 1 hit point can:
- <span style="background:yellow">Regain all lost hit points. </span>
- _Regain and use abilities that indicate they require a long rest._
- _Regain a number of spent Hit Dice equal to half the character’s total number of Hit Dice (minimum 1)._
- _Reduce their exhaustion level by 1, if they have also ingested food and drink._


## Burgeoning Heroes
Each character begins with 5 extra hit points.

## Death Saves
To add even more tension to these moments, the player
make the death save in secret. This means the other
players won't know how close that character is to death,
adding a sense of urgency to the moment that it might
not otherwise have.

A failed Death Save result in one level of excaustion.

## Healing Spirit (spell)
The spell ends once the spirit has restored hit points a number of times equal to twice your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once)
