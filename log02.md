## Destruction and Distraction
Our heroes recuperated from their fight. They rested, Syrian restored Solwynn’s memory, and they finally fixed the Scavenger. Gargauth told Syrian that he needed to send messages to both Bel and Tiamat. When Syrian asked what he wanted to say, he said he needed to convince them to ally with him against Zariel. They then wondered if he thought Eliza had been sent by Zariel, to which Gargauth said, “Either her or Bel. If it’s Bel, I want him to think I’m on his side.”

They then discussed strategy. They wanted to:

Go to Elturel to stock up on healing items and regroup.
Go to The Wandering Emporium to have Fhet’Ahla send messages (Gargauth knew an imp named Fhet’Ahla when he ran the place; if they’re the same fiend, they might owe him).
Head up to Bitter Breath’s camp, hopefully to retrieve some soul coins and a heartstone.
Cross the river to retrieve the ice lenses from Rigorath at the Mirror of Mephistar.
Race back to Fort Knucklebone to provide Mad Maggie with all the pieces before the lenses melt.
Whew.
Once the Scavenger was repaired enough to drive, they headed to Elturel. When they arrived, they noticed the city was significantly lower than it had been. They left it about 500 feet up, and it was now around 300 feet up. They saw there were nine pillars holding the chains that were dragging the city down, and a domed structure underneath the center of the city, on an outcropping in the river. They also saw that this clearly wasn’t the first city taken in such a way; there were fragments of numerous other cities scattered around the area.

They decided it was time to enter the city. Erin flew Shadow and Kellen up, while Syrian and Solwynn dimension doored up, followed closely by Erin and Bartimaeus. When they arrived in the city, it was dead quiet. Kellen and Shadow looked for tracks, and found three sets of humanoid tracks amongst the tracks of something with larger feet.

They followed the tracks and soon there was a voice behind them. “Shadow?” and Reyus Mantlemorn came up behind him and a group hug was had. It turns out Reyus, Pashka Krasku, and Lephit Ezim were on a mission to retrieve holy symbols from a former manufacturing facility to prevent them from being destroyed by what they thought might be an impending army of undead. They had a brief discussion about what was going on, and Reyus cut it short so they could get to the High Hall and have that discussion with leadership.

As they entered the central city, formerly the gardens north of the High Hall, they saw armed guards patrolling the area, and even some guards training civilians. Reyus led the party up the hill to the High Hall where they met Bastion Featherbottom II and Ontharr Frume, along with a few others on the newly-formed council. Featherbottom asked what the party had found, and they related what was happening and their upcoming plans. Featherbottom told them the central city was mostly locked down now, and travel between there and Helm’s Shieldhall was relatively safe. The western city was held by devils, and for the time being it was a stalemate, although the devils were gearing up for an assault. Erin asked if they knew who the leader was. Featherbottom sighed and told him Thalamra Vanthampur was back in charge.

Ontharr’s plan was to use the party and Elturel’s five viable adventurers to form two teams. One would be a stealth team, trying to sneak into a dock where the enemy is hauling up infernal war machines, and the second would be an assault team, sent to destroy caches of explosives, serving both as destruction and as a distraction the stealth team can exploit. Ultimately the two teams would meet and attack their base of operations, which is heavily defended enough to require a force of ten. Featherbottom had a different, secret mission for Bartimaeus, and sent him off elsewhere.

The first team to assault an explosives warehouse was Syrian, Ontharr, Reyus, Lephit, and Pherria Jynks. Ontharr, Reyus and Pherria all had Protection from Good & Evil cast on them, which made it more difficult than usual for the fiends to attack them. Ontharr and Reyus plowed through the wall of bearded devils, leaving Syrian to be able to detonate the explosives with a conveniently-placed fireball. The explosion was seen and heard through the whole western city, even where the stealth team was about to start their mission.



## Shadowboxing
Shadow, Erin, Kellen, Solwynn, and Pashka saw the explosion and heard shouting in Infernal, but none of these particular heroes could translate what they heard. Their target, the war machine depot, was on the other side of a large wall with towers. Their mission for now was to get past that wall. They debated their options for communication and capabilities, and decided the whole team should take the alley with the most cover to get closer to the wall. Solwynn scrambled up one of the buildings to see if he could get a better perspective from the roof. He saw a few devils standing guard, then dropped back down to relay that information to the team.

Erin was first out. He snuck over to a corner, out of sight from most of the devils, and climbed the wall near there. He crouched down near the tower, and pulled out some of the pomegranate-like Styx fruit that Solwynn had grown. He cast greater invisibility on himself and snuck over to one of the bearded devils standing guard. Wearing gloves, he cut one of the fruit and dumped the juice over the devil. The devil staggered a little bit, seeming confused. Erin quickly went to the other one and did the same, with the same effect. He misty stepped down to the bottom of the internal side of the wall and ran to another devil, attempting another soaking. Whereas he did soak the devil in the Styx juice, it didn’t have the same effect, and the devil started shouting to his comrades in infernal, although he still couldn’t detect Erin’s presence. Erin lobbed a cut fruit over to another devil (looking as though it had been thrown by the devil he was standing near), and it splattered in his hands, but also he was unaffected.

At this time Shadow snuck over and climbed the wall where the two befuddled devils were. He remained hidden while the rest of the party was sneaking over, and quickly realized that with the ruckus being raised by Erin’s shenanigans, this was not going to end quietly. He attacked one of the befuddled devils to draw attention away from the others. Erin dropped his invisibility so he could haste Shadow.

Solwynn snuck up to the wall, and leapt off the wall to the internal side, misty stepping far enough to grab onto the ledge of another roof, and Kellen went up and over. Pashka ran to Shadow and was going to dimension door the two of them to safety, but Shadow chose not to go with him.

Shadow ran, and with his already obscene speed doubled, he led the devils around on a wild goose chase, covering the rest of the party’s escape. He moved to the external side, climbing, chasing, hiding and jumping enough to spin the devils’ heads. He finally ran over a roof and jumped back on the tower wall, hiding, while the devils fanned out to search for him where he wasn’t. He then snuck away to the rest of the party, to pursue the next leg of the journey.



## Barnstorming
Syrian, Ontharr, Reyus, Lephit and Pherria stood outside the barn they were next to assault. They had two doors to access the two-story building: a barn door and a smaller, more human-sized door. Syrian listened at the door, and heard both human and devil voices talking in Infernal, discussing the last cache the party had hit. In preparation, Ontharr cast protection from good & evil on himself, and Pherria cast it on Reyus.

They knew they would take longer to open the barn door than the smaller door, so they tied off the handles of the barn door and burst through the smaller one. The party stormed the building, headed by Ontharr and Reyus. Syrian was ecstatic that some of the combatants were humans, and he unleashed a couple well-placed fireballs to clear some of them out. He then unleashed spirit guardians, which helped to pick away at any of the combatants within fifteen feet of him. He was so successful with that that Pherria dropped her protection from good and evil on Reyus to cast her own set of spirit guardians, running under the stairs to the second floor to target a wider selection of devils coming down from above.

The party first destroyed the lower floor, then ran up the stairs. Syrian was about to cast fireball at the top of the stairs on several humans, but Gargauth let him know that would set off the explosives they were all crowded around, which would end the adventure prematurely. Instead he cast radiance of the dawn, which was nearly as effective, with a wider audience.

About a minute after they entered the building it was clear of enemies. They dumped a torch on the explosives and walked out of the building, their back to another huge explosion.



## Offensive Driving
Shortly after the next explosion, Shadow, Erin, Kellen, Solwynn, and Pashka arrived at one of the temple districts. Looking around, they saw that there were several devils in a large courtyard bordering two large temples. Outside one of the temples were a few infernal war machines, and it appeared they had found what they were looking for. They snuck down a side street, behind some buildings, to where a few bearded devils were watching the area. They picked a few off one-by-one, and realized that wasn’t going to be sufficient to clear out the temple area.

From their vantage point, the could see a scavenger and a demon grinder sitting idle, with the scavenger still running. Erin hasted Shadow, and then Kellen and Erin dimension doored into the demon grinder, while Solwynn and Pashka dimension doored into the scavenger. Carnage ensued.

Kellen and Solwynn both drove their respective vehicles around and over numerous devils, crushing most of them completely. Shadow ran to the demon grinder and manned the wrecking ball, which they then used on the remaining two infernal machines. Many of the devils tried vainly to fight back, and eventually got the idea to get into the infernal machines to give a more effective attack. This was nipped in the bud by the still-hasted Shadow and his prodigious use of the wrecking ball.

Soon, the devils were fleeing, some into the temples, and the party followed. The temples were thoroughly trashed on the inside, with merregons guarding the front entrance and the back wall completely demolished.

Our heroes blew through the temple, finding a hole on the other side, that had a crane attached, and a dock with several war machines around it. Some of those war machines were starting up, and ready to attack. Kellen, Erin, and Shadow ran through as many vehicles as they could, while being chased by another demon grinder. Solwynn and Pashka took on two scavengers with their one, and barely made it out.

Once everything was in pieces around them, they had a single demon grinder at half strength. The crane at the bottom had a fresh new demon grinder, and several devils on the ground far below. They happily dropped the remaining hulks of war machines on the devils below them and hauled the pristine demon grinder up to the city before destroying the crane.

All that was left was to drive through the city to the prison and rendezvous with the assault party.




## Breaking Into Prison
Our heroes made their way to the city prison, and entered the building as two groups. Our regular set of heroes entered the south side while Ontharr, Reyus, Pherria, Lephit, and Pashka entered from the north. Ontharr, who had been inside the building many times and knew the layout, stormed in. Although his weak human eyes couldn’t see in the darkness, he quickly alerted some bearded devils. The fight was on! Pherria cast protection from good and evil on Reyus, who leapt into the fray, while Lephit stood at a safe distance and Pashka joined the fight. They quickly defeated the devils and were ready to move on.

Meanwhile, the south team entered into what looked like a communal dining area, occupied by several merregons and hell hounds. Erin cast protection from good and evil on Shadow, and Kellen cast it on himself. During the fight, Solwynn noticed that there were more devils entering from another room, and cast an acid ball into that room, which served to alert everyone else in that room to come join the fray. Soon, there was a wall of devils attacking our heroes, and Kellen, in a rather unfortunate attack, lost his concentration on his protection spell. The party still defeated their foes quickly, and moved into the kitchen area beyond the dining room.

The north team, emboldened by their success and Ontharr’s knowledge of the building, barged straight into the central prison area, with Pherria using thaumaturgy to tell the devils within to yield in the name of Torm. She stumbled in the midst of her declaration when she realized just how many enemies were in the room, and it was less effective than she had hoped. Suddenly, an alarm blared, altering the whole facility of their presence.

The south team, running through the kitchen, heard Pherria’s shout and the alarm and ran north to help. Erin, Shadow, and Syrian ran into a side hall to deal with a merregon and hell hound, while Kellen moved closer to the central chamber. Solwynn came behind him and cast protection from good and evil on him. Kellen, emboldened by his new protection, hesitated and retreated down the side hall to join the other three.

While this was happening, Ontharr and Reyus were being swarmed from the front, while Pherria was holding up the narrow hallway to the rear. A nearby chain devil was releasing zombies in the prison cells surrounding the central chamber while the party was being swarmed by merregons. Pherria fell to the onslaught of a merrgon, and Reyus leapt to her aid. He received due punishment from the merregon for his nobility, and had to lay hands on himself to stay alive. Ontharr had little patience for the swarm of unholy beings nearby and turned every one of them, causing the entire crowd to flee.

Shadow intercepted a hell hound (the companion of the merregon fighting Reyus), and the rest of the south team ran into the narrow hallway to the north of the central building. The merregon, recently turned, was intercepted by Erin, who attacked him mercilessly. Between his and Reyus’ ministrations, the merregon quickly fell.

Then they noticed that the zombies were being freed much quicker than usual, and saw two more chain devils coming towards them. Due to the recent turning, the team was looking for more devils to abuse, and these chain devils won their attentions. As they were attacking the chain devils, who should appear from the other end of the guard tower, but Bartimaeus. He took down a zombie and started the assault on some of the chain devils.

Then Thalamra Vanthampur, looking much more evil than anyone remembered, appeared. She shouted out to Solwynn, in a vicious tone he had heard many a time. The team proceeded to change their tactics to try to bring her down. Lephit unleashed her steel wind strike, killing four of the five remaining enemies, but failing so miserably in attacking Thalamra that Thalamra actually controlled her temporarily. It didn’t last long, because Erin was able to finish her off, but not before she got some powerful hits in on him.

All that was left was a chain devil, a merregon, and a couple wights in the guard tower in the center. They burst out and Shadow stepped in front of them to protect his friends. Erin, barely standing himself, yelled to Shadow, “Don’t let the wights touch you!” Shadow then stepped back to finish the enemies off with his bow.

Bartimaeus’ eldritch blast was so powerful, it displaced the remaining chain devil in time, making him disappear briefly. This Ontharr and Kellen the opportunity to destroy the remaining merregon and another wight, before it came back and was ended by Syrian’s spirit guardians.

All that remained was further mopping up of zombies, then moving through the prison to clean the place out. They came to a store room, where they dispatched a chain devil and three imps. They then found a wight and a deathlock, killing some civilians herded into an exercise yard, possibly to be raised as zombies later.

As they passed through the southern hall, they opened the south door, on their way out. There they found Eliza, waiting for them. Upon seeing them, Eliza facepalmed. Upon seeing her, Syrian slowly closed the door.

Erin gained the courage to step outside and greet her. She told them, “We both know that now would be a great time for me to take the shield by force, but that’s not why I’m here. I just came to get the body of my sister. Although the offer of ten soul coins for the shield is still open.” They weren’t clear at first who her sister would be, until they suggested “Thalamra Vanthampur?” Eliza said yes to the Thalamra part, but didn’t know what Vanthampur meant.

Shadow went to get the body while Erin walked closer to speak with her. He asked after her employer again, and she declined to say again. He explained that they were working with Gargauth to make him the new ruler of Avernus, in an effort to depose Zariel. She listened impassively until Erin invited her to his wedding. Before she left, she committed to dancing with Shadow at Erin’s wedding if they all succeeded in their mission. She then took Thalamra’s body and flew up and away.

The party then decided to check through the rest of the prison to catch anything else they may have missed. They did find two wights and a deathlock killing a roomful of civilians, most of which were already dead by the time the party arrived. The party made quick work of the undead, and brought the survivors out along with the civilians they had previously saved. They loaded as many people as possible into the demon grinder, and made their way to the central city. With several civilians in the demon grinder, and most of our heroes walking behind as they made their way up the slope of the central city to the cheers of the humans present, it was as much a parade of victory as anything our heroes had experienced yet.
