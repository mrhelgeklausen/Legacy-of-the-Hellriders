# The companion

The Companion was a magical second sun that hovered over the city of Elturel in Elturgard. It was the symbol of the realm and its defenders, the Order of the Companion. Zariel created the Companion as part of a plot to pull the city into Avernus to use it as a fortress in the Blood War. 

While it was in the sky above Elturel, the Companion was a shining golden orb, hanging directly over the High Hall. In Elturel, the Companion was as bright as the natural sun in the daytime, but unlike the natural sun, it never moved through the sky, and it never set. 

The people of Elturgard could see the Companion from nearly anywhere. Some 50 miles away from Elturel, it cast a pale dawn light. Further away, it was a bright beacon in the sky, and from as far away as Berdusk and Boareskyr Bridge, it was an unmoving star hanging low over the horizon.

Creatures and things vulnerable to daylight in some way, or even destroyed by it, were just as vulnerable to the Companion's light. Thus it prevented darkling races and monsters from assailing the city. Undead of all kinds found it painful or were even burned by it, while creatures of darkness could not even bear to look at the city.
