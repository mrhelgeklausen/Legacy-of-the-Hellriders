# VAMPIRISM
Neither curse nor disease, vampirism is a terrible
transformation that turns a creature who has been
bitten by a vampire - or who's accepted a dark bargain -
into an Undead abomination that must sustain itself by
drinking blood. Most who are transformed this way turn
into near-mindless vampire spawn, beholden to their
vampiric master. Some, however, manage to retain their
free will while embracing their newfound powers. 

## Vampire feats
The character can embrace the vampirism and acquire vampiric feats when they gain
**Ability Score Improvements**, as per the rules for feats in
fifth edition. The feats are presented in the order they
can be taken and the traits they grant are cumulative.

### VAMPIRE FLEDGLING
Prerequisite: Having been bitten by a vampire.
Your vampiric transformation has begun. You gain
the following flaws and benefits:

- **Darkvision.** You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
-  **Undead.** Your creature type is Undead. You don't age and have no need for air. You have no reflection and cast no shadow. You have no need for food or water but
must instead drink at least half a gallon of blood from a Humanoid or Beast each 10-day.
- **Blood Thirst.** You can drain blood and life energy from a willing creature, or one that is grappled by you, incapacitated, or restrained. Make a melee attack 
against the target. If you hit, you deal 1 piercing damage and 1d6 necrotic damage. The targetâ€™s hit point 
maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and you regain hit points equal to 
that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its 
hit point maximum to 0
